# Computer Vision

This repository contains my implementations and experiments with computer vision algorithms that I found interesting in the course CSE 573 at SUNY Buffalo.

## Algorithms implemented:

1. Edge Detection by Zero-crossing

2. Fourier Transform of image and Image reconstruction using Inverse Fourier transform

3. Image Compression using Laplacian and Gaussian Pyramids

4. Image segmentation using Region Merging by Boundary melting algorithm
